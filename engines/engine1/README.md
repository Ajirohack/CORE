# Workflow Execution Engine

## Overview

The Workflow Execution Engine (Engine 1) is responsible for processing and managing workflow executions within the SpaceNew architecture. It acts as the primary entry point for workflow-based processing in the system.

## Key Components

### Workflow Executor

- Manages the execution of workflow steps
- Tracks workflow status, progress, and results
- Records workflow execution history in the database
- Handles error management and recovery

### Agents

This directory contains specialized agent implementations that can be invoked during workflow execution. Agents provide domain-specific processing capabilities.

### Workflows

This directory contains workflow definitions that coordinate sequences of operations to accomplish specific tasks. Each workflow consists of a series of steps that are executed in sequence.

## Integration Points

- **Input**: Receives workflow execution requests from the System Engine Control
- **Output**: Passes processed data to Engine 2 for further processing
- **Database**: Records workflow execution history and results

## Usage

```python
from engine1.workflow_executor import execute_workflow, example_step

# Define workflow steps
steps = [example_step]

# Execute workflow
execute_workflow("workflow-123", steps, "sample input")
```

## Status

- [x] Basic workflow execution framework implemented
- [x] Database integration for tracking workflow execution
- [ ] Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Agent implementation templates
- [ ] Sample workflow definitions

## Next Steps

1. Implement specific agent types for different processing needs
2. Create standard workflow templates
3. Enhance error handling and recovery capabilities
4. Add monitoring and reporting features
