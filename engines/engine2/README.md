# Data Processing & Transformation Engine

## Overview

The Data Processing & Transformation Engine (Engine 2) is responsible for processing and transforming data received from Engine 1. It serves as the middle layer in the engine pipeline, focusing on data enrichment, formatting, and preparation for advanced operations.

## Key Components

### Agents

This directory contains specialized agents focused on:

- Data normalization and standardization
- Entity extraction and recognition
- Format conversion and transformation
- Data enrichment and augmentation

### Workflows

This directory contains workflow definitions specific to data processing tasks, including:

- Document processing workflows
- Media content transformation workflows
- Data enrichment and augmentation workflows
- Entity extraction and enrichment workflows

## Integration Points

- **Input**: Receives processed data from Engine 1
- **Output**: Passes transformed and enriched data to Engine 3
- **RAG System**: Interacts with the RAG system for data enrichment
- **Packages/Tools**: Leverages external tools for specialized processing tasks

## Functionality

Engine 2 transforms raw or partially processed data into fully structured formats suitable for advanced processing. It applies various transformations, enrichments, and standardizations to prepare data for downstream processing.

## Status

- [x] Basic directory structure established
- [ ] Agent implementations for core data processing functions
- [ ] Standard workflow definitions
- [ ] Integration with RAG system for data enrichment
- [ ] Integration with external tools and packages

## Next Steps

1. Implement core data processing agents
2. Define standard workflows for common transformation tasks
3. Integrate with the RAG system for content enrichment
4. Add specialized processing for different data types (text, images, etc.)
