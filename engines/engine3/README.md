# AI Processing & Reasoning Engine

## Overview

The AI Processing & Reasoning Engine (Engine 3) provides advanced AI capabilities within the SpaceNew architecture. It focuses on applying reasoning, inference, and decision-making to the enriched data from Engine 2.

## Key Components

### Agents

This directory contains specialized AI agent implementations, including:

- Reasoning agents for logical deduction and inference
- Decision-making agents for option evaluation and selection
- Planning agents for multi-step task planning
- Specialized domain agents for vertical-specific reasoning

### Workflows

This directory contains workflow definitions for AI processing tasks:

- Multi-step reasoning workflows
- Decision trees and evaluation frameworks
- Planning and execution sequences
- Knowledge integration workflows

## Integration Points

- **Input**: Receives enriched and structured data from Engine 2
- **Output**: Passes processed results to Engine 4 for final execution
- **AI Council**: Interacts with the AI/Sentic Council for orchestration and guidance
- **RAG System**: Uses knowledge retrieval for context-aware reasoning

## Functionality

Engine 3 applies AI reasoning, planning, and decision-making capabilities to structured data. It represents the "thinking" layer of the engine pipeline, focusing on intelligent processing rather than execution.

## Status

- [x] Basic directory structure established
- [ ] Core AI agent implementations
- [ ] Standard reasoning workflows
- [ ] Integration with AI Council
- [ ] Integration with RAG system for knowledge-based reasoning

## Next Steps

1. Implement foundational reasoning agents
2. Define standard AI processing workflows
3. Integrate with the AI Council for orchestration
4. Add specialized reasoning for different domains and use cases
5. Implement knowledge integration with the RAG system
