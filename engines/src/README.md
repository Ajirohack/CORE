# Shared Engine Source Code

## Overview

This directory contains shared source code, utilities, and common functionality used across all engine implementations in the SpaceNew architecture.

## Components

### Common Utilities

- Logging and monitoring utilities
- Error handling and recovery patterns
- Performance measurement tools
- Configuration management

### Shared Models

- Common data models and structures
- Interface definitions
- Type definitions and annotations

### Integration Utilities

- Communication patterns between engines
- Serialization and deserialization utilities
- Transport layer abstractions

## Usage

Modules in this directory can be imported by any engine implementation. They provide consistent patterns and utilities to ensure uniformity across the engine pipeline.

Example:

```python
from core.engines.src.logging import setup_logger
from core.engines.src.error_handling import try_execute

# Setup logging
logger = setup_logger("engine1")

# Use error handling
result = try_execute(some_function, fallback_value=None)
```

## Extending

When adding new shared functionality:

1. Place the implementation in an appropriate module
2. Ensure it's designed to be engine-agnostic
3. Add appropriate tests and documentation
4. Update this README with any new major components

## Status

- [ ] Implement core shared utilities
- [ ] Define common interfaces and models
- [ ] Add communication patterns between engines
- [ ] Create standard error handling mechanisms
